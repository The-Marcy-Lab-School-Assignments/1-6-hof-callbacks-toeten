# Question
What is an "inline function"? Give an example with your definition.

# Answer
An inline function is a function that is defined in the code where it is used rather than as a separate helper function outside of your HOF. For example:
````js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const squaredNumbers = numbers.map((x) => x * x);

console.log(squaredNumbers); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

````
(x) => x * x is the inline function here.
