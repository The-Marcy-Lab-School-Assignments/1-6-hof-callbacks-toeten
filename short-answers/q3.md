# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
We are invoking the function printDouble within our .forEach(). This results in the value of the function printDouble (undefined, since it doesn't return anything) being passed as the callback function. This will lead to an error since undefined is not a function (its just a value).
